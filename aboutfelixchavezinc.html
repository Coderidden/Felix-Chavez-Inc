<p id="felixText">Felix Chavez, Inc. was founded in 1982
by Felix O. Chavez, Chief Designer and Artist. Originally named Fine
Art Decorating Company and in 1993 was replaced with our actual name.</p>
<p id="felixText">Now we have the great honor to inform
and state a brief history about one of the oldest established companies
in the United States within the industry of restoration, conservation,
and creation of new decorative design in old classical manner skills
and all kinds of techniques in interior architectural features around
New York State and across the country.</p>
<p id="felixText">Our nearly 40 years as a company has
allowed us to become the single most artful entity, unequaled in
quality.</p>
<p id="felixText">Our staff of artists and artisans have
the highest level of study and experience.</p>
<p id="felixText">This is the only company to provide an
unparalled guarantee of 50 years minimum on the stability of our skills
especially in new decorative finishes. No one else even mentions
durability in addition to beauty.</p>
<p id="felixText">This organization is unique and original
because it is the creator of the opalescent technique which consist of
transforming any modest material such as plaster elements, stone,
metals, wood, poultry, etc. into a beautiful noble material;
appropriate for modern and classical decoration.</p>
<p id="felixText">But it is better to hear from other art
lovers and experts on their opinions which are more interesting about
our institution than the company's owners and staff. Please click here
